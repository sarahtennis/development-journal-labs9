## Project
### Knowledge Without College

Knowledge Without College is a job board that connects employers with talented job seekers who may not have a college degree. This paid job posting service encourages employers to emphasize the skills desired in an employee rather than focusing on formal education.

## Analysis
The majority of the work I completed this week was fixing bugs after manually testing the project as a user. I went through and made sure that all links and buttons had the same animation and color scheme.

## Reflections
Mid-week I got sick and spent the majority of a day in urgent care and then the ER for very minor surgery. Through this my team members have been unbelievably kind. I felt as though I did not pull my weight this week, not a feeling I like, but they took care of everything I couldn't help with. Once we redo the video for the WEB14X Capstone Defense I will make sure to contribute as much as possible.

Labs has been a stressful, educational, and in the end rewarding experience.
